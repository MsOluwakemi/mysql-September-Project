Does having multiple conditions affect likelihood of showing up
## Communication Effectiveness
Does receiving an SMS reminder improve attendance rates?
How effective are reminders across different age groups?
## Technology Used
this is sql project. a single query technique was used to run the query coupled with aggregate function which was then used 
to aggregate large rows of dat into a small rows of data given the information we need
